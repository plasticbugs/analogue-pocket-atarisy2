# Super Sprint core constraints.
#
# The Pocket BSP (platform/pocket/bsp/pocket/sys_constr.sdc) creates the APF
# clocks; this file describes what is specific to this core.
# ==============================================================================

# ==============================================================================
# Clock groups
#
# core_pll general[0] = clk_sys       96.0 MHz  machine, renderer, SDRAM
#          general[1] = clk_vid       16.0 MHz  dot clock, exactly clk_sys / 6
#          general[2] = clk_vid 90deg 16.0 MHz
#          general[3]                 96.0 MHz  SDRAM pin clock, phase shifted
#          general[4]                 unused
#
# clk_sys and the two pixel clocks stay in ONE group on purpose. The renderer
# emits a pixel every sixth clk_sys cycle and the APF scaler samples it on
# clk_vid; they are integer-related outputs of the same PLL, so that crossing is
# synchronous by construction and should be verified rather than cut. Cutting it
# would let each build route it blind and make the picture depend on the fitter
# seed.
#
# clk_74a, clk_74b, the bridge SPI clock and the audio PLL are genuinely
# asynchronous to the machine. The one multi-bit bus that crosses into clk_74b
# -- the audio sample -- is handed over with a toggle flag in core_top, so the
# capture is always of a value that has been still for several cycles
# (METHODOLOGY 5.4).

# ==============================================================================
# SDRAM
#
# The chip is clocked from core_pll general[3]: the same 96 MHz as the
# controller, phase-shifted. The phase and the exception below are DERIVED from
# the analyser's own numbers on a real fit, not assumed:
#
#   clock network, PLL output -> dram_clk pin          12.56 ns
#   clock network, PLL output -> dq_in register clock   7.9 ns
#   dram_dq pin -> dq_in register                        2.84 ns
#   chip access time tAC (max) + board                   7.0 ns
#   chip output hold tOH (min)                           2.5 ns
#
# The pin edge therefore trails the same nominal PLL edge by 4.66 ns more than
# the register's clock does. With phase 3650 ps the chip's edge at its pin
# lands about 1.2 ns BEFORE the controller's internal edge, which puts every
# transfer near the middle of its window:
#
#   command launched on our edge E: at the pin E+3, sampled by the chip at its
#     edge E+8.3 -- 5.3 ns setup; the previous chip edge was E-2.1 and the old
#     command holds until E+3 -- 5.1 ns hold.
#   read data: the chip drives it 7.0 ns after its edge, it reaches dq_in 9.84
#     after, i.e. 7.7 ns after our edge -- captured on our NEXT edge with 2.7 ns
#     to spare; the following word cannot arrive before 13.3 -- 2.9 ns hold.
#
# That capture is one full internal period after the chip's edge, but the
# nominal relationship between the two clocks is only 6.76 ns, because the
# extra 4.66 ns of network delay to the pin is not part of the waveform. So the
# analyser's default pairing checks a capture edge the data cannot possibly
# meet, and a multicycle of 2 (hold 1) moves it to the edge the RTL actually
# uses -- READ+4 at the pins, rd_late=1 in sdram16. This is the exception the
# first build lacked a basis for: it had the same numbers on a clock inverted
# by hand, and there the second edge was still 5.2 ns short.
#
# The original controller clocked the chip on an inverted copy of our clock and
# captured on the first edge, leaving 5.2 ns for a 7 ns access. With the
# exception that hid it removed, every dram_dq input missed by 7.5 ns, and on
# the Pocket every sprite was garbage while the block-RAM backgrounds were
# perfect.
#
# The clock is named dram_clk because the BSP (sys_constr.sdc) applies the
# chip's tDS/tDH to a clock of that name -- though it runs before this file and
# never finds it, so those two lines are repeated below.

# --- controller round-robin arbiter ------------------------------------------
# A client's `req` is a genuinely single-cycle input -- it can rise on the clock
# before the controller happens to be sitting in S_IDLE -- so req -> SDRAM_A can
# never be multicycled. It measured 15.3 ns (rom_req, the last failing path
# outside the CPU cores) and was fixed in the RTL instead: the S_ARB state now
# splits the accept from the address drive, leaving req -> pick -> cur (~5.5 ns)
# and c_addr -> mux -> SDRAM_A (~9 ns) as two honest single-cycle paths.
#
# `last` is different. It is the index of the client served last and is written
# only when S_IDLE accepts a client. Everything it feeds -- the round-robin
# scan, hence pick -> cur, any_req -> state, and the burst branch's
# (b_yield && any_req) gate -- is read only in S_IDLE, and after an acceptance
# the controller cannot be back in S_IDLE for 7 clocks (ARB, OPEN1, OPEN2,
# WAIT3..WAIT1 on a write; 9 on a read). 3/2 is well inside that.

# register in the block -- the AUDF/AUDC/AUDCTL/SKCTL registers, the four
# counters, the polynomial counters, the prescalers and the summed output --
# changes only in a cen_cpu clock and is captured only in the next one, 53
# clocks later. The whole MAME step_one_clock (four counters, four LFSRs,
# the filters and the 6-bit sum) is one combinational chain inside that
# window; it measured 14.7 ns (counter -> sum, -4.30 ns at 96 MHz), so 8/7
# as for the T65 is conservative. The read mux (rdata, combinational) and
# the reset are cross-block and stay single-cycle.

# register changes only in a cen_cpu clock, the same enable the POKEY captures
# on -- so the write decode that gates the step (a STIMER or SKCTL write in
# the cen clock takes precedence over the step) has the same 53-clock window.
# It measured 10.9 ns (T65 address -> we -> step -> borrow, -0.55 ns). The
# jt51 is NOT covered by anything like this: its write interface samples
# cs_n / wr_n on every clock, so T65 -> jt51 stays single-cycle (and passes).
